In Laundry Loops, you play as a charismatic sock who just wanted a peaceful day until a careless shove sends you tumbling into a looping nightmare of rinse, spin, and chaos. Dodge rogue t-shirts, slippery underwear, and detergent waves as you fight to survive a cycle of washing phases like deep soak, bleach storm, and turbo dry. Will you escape the loop, or become laundry lint forever?",
