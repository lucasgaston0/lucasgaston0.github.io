You’re a robot with an internal self-destruct module on a 30-second timer, and your survival depends on grabbing shimmering energy crystals scattered through a fractured canyon and taking down enemy bots to recharge your battery. Master parkour, collect energy sources to extend your runtime, and balance risk vs. reward: ¿Slow and safe, or fast and dangerous?",
